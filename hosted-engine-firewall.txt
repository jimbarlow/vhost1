[ INFO  ] Creating VM
          You can now connect to the VM with the following command:
                hosted-engine --console
          You can also graphically connect to the VM from your system with the following command:
                remote-viewer vnc://vhost1.barlows.local:5900
          Use temporary password "1672PNuf" to connect to vnc console.
          Please ensure that your Guest OS is properly configured to support serial console according to your distro documentation.
          Follow http://www.ovirt.org/Serial_Console_Setup#I_need_to_access_the_console_the_old_way for more info.
          If you need to reboot the VM you will need to start it manually using the command:
          hosted-engine --vm-start
          You can then set a temporary password using the command:
          hosted-engine --add-console-password
          Please install and setup the engine in the VM.
          You may also be interested in installing ovirt-guest-agent-common package in the VM.
